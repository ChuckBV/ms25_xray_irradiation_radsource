# Summary and Analysis for a 2025 Manuscript Based on X-ray Irradiation of NOW Adults

https://github.com/ChuckBV/ms25_xray_irradiation_radsource

The data come from a series of experiments conducted on navel orangeworm adults 
in 2022 and 2023 using a Radsource RS1800-Q irradiator. 
This respository is organized as a single directory containing data sets in 
a single  Excel file ("Dataset.xlsx") and a series of R Markdown files providing 
and explaining summary and analysis of the experiments. The files were output as 
MS Word files, which were printed locally as PDF documents and appended as a 
single sequential document included here as "xray_study_r_outputfiles.pdf"
